            <p class="text-lg text-gray-200">
                Religion is a system of faith and worship that encompasses beliefs, practices, and moral guidelines 
                that connect individuals to a higher power or divine entity. It is a way for people to seek meaning, purpose, 
                and understanding in their lives. Throughout history, religion has played a central role in shaping cultures, 
                providing ethical frameworks, and guiding individuals toward spiritual fulfillment and peace.
